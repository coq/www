<h2>What is OPAM</h2>

<p>OPAM is the package manager for the OCaml programming language, the language
in which Coq is implemented.
Instructions on
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html">how to install OPAM</a>
itself are available on the OPAM website.</p>

<p>By following the instructions on this web page one installs the last stable
version of Coq and all additional packages in a <em>switch</em> <code>with-coq-<#CURRENTVERSION></code>.
Instructions target an OPAM newcomer.</p>

<h2>Using OPAM to install Coq</h2>

<p>Once the <code>opam</code> command is available, i.e. OPAM is installed, one can
proceed as follows (using opam 2):</p>

<pre><code>
# Initialize the opam root (at ~/.opam by default) and create a switch named "with-coq-<#CURRENTVERSION>"
# This will prompt you to allow opam to set up initialization scripts, which is generally fine to accept.
# "-j 2" is the number of CPU cores to use.
# By default the global OCaml installation will be used. opam can also install and use a different
# version of OCaml (e.g., <#OCAMLV>) by adding here the option "--compiler=ocaml-base-compiler.<#OCAMLV>".
opam init --switch=with-coq-<#CURRENTVERSION> -j 2

# Activate the repository for Coq packages.
opam repo add coq-released http://coq.inria.fr/opam/released

# Pin the coq package to version <#CURRENTVERSION> and install it.
opam pin add coq <#CURRENTVERSION>
</code></pre>

<p>If using <code>opam 1.2</code>, the <code>init</code> command should be:</p>

<pre><code>opam init -n --comp <#OCAMLV>
</code></pre>

<p>One may also want to install CoqIDE. Note that this requires GTK+ development
files (gtksourceview2) to be available on the system.</p>

<pre><code>opam install coqide
</code></pre>

<p>For alternative user interfaces / editors, see instructions on their own
homepage, e.g. <a href="https://proofgeneral.github.io/#quick-installation-instructions">https://proofgeneral.github.io/#quick-installation-instructions</a>
for Proof-General.</p>

<h2>Running Coq</h2>

<p>If you couldn't allow <code>opam</code> to set up initialization scripts
at the <code>opam init</code> step above,
every time a new shell is opened you have to type in the following lines in order to use Coq:</p>

<pre><code>
eval `opam config env`
</code></pre>

<p>To check that the installation was successful, <code>coqc -v</code> should print the version of Coq.</p>

<h2>Using OPAM to install Coq packages</h2>

<p>If Coq has been installed as described above, the list of available Coq
packages can be accessed as follows</p>

<pre><code>opam search coq
</code></pre>

<p>The command lists the Coq package names followed by a short description.
One can access a more detailed description of a package, say <code>coq-sudoku</code>,
by typing</p>

<pre><code>opam show coq-sudoku
</code></pre>

<p>One can install the package by typing</p>

<pre><code>opam install coq-sudoku
</code></pre>
